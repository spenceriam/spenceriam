### A 1st Edition D&D-style Adventure

venture forth into the darkness...

  You smash the amulet with your mace. A blinding flash of light erupts, and the wraith's form dissipates into nothingness.
  
  <b>Victory! The tomb is cleansed of evil.</b>
  
  Among the wraith's treasures, you find an enchanted shield and a scroll of ancient wisdom.
